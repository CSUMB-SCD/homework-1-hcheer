1. this project was about setting up a standard workflow with C9 git and heroku
2. the goal focused on developing an understanding of what is required in properly set up a project
3. **Issues:** had to overwrite an existing repo previously made using -f went well after that
4. I don't know what else to exactly improve on right now, possibly allow to make multiple chatters

Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
